		    OWL: OpenStreetMap Watch List
		    =============================

OWL isn't really a single bit of software, it's a collection of
scripts and programs built up in a very ad-hoc way. And, of course,
almost completely lacking in documentation. Hopefully that will
change!

Contents:
---------

cpp/
	The OWL C++ components. This includes the central bit of
	software which parses the diffs (.osc) from OpenStreetMap and
	populates a database with the tiled changes. It also includes
	a "plugin" for keeping the duplicate nodes map.

owl_viewer/
	A rails project which hosts the owl "viewer" which allows
	people to browse changes in their area and generates the RSS
	feeds.

scripts/
	Miscellaneous scripts to keep bits of the database up-to-date,
	like the OWL changeset details scraper.

dupe_nodes/
	The scripts for the duplicate nodes map.
