			 OWL VIEWER RAILS APP
			 ====================

This is a rails app (although it's not really used in a railsy way)
which provides the main UI to OWL, viewing changes and providing RSS
feeds for areas.

TODO
----

* Make more railsy, with more than one controller, etc... proper
  modelification of the OWL database?

* Make translatable?
