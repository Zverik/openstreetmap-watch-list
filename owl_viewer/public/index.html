<center><h1>OWL: OpenStreetMap Watch List</h1></center>
<p>This is a service for looking at what's changed in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> where you're interested in. Rather than calculate
the bounding box of all changes in a changeset, this service attaches changes to small lat/lon tiles, which are more fine-grained and more easily
queryable (in theory, anyway...)</p>
<p>There are maps of changes over the last <a href="dailymap">day</a>, <a href="weeklymap">week</a> or <a href="map">forever</a> (well, since OWL
started running).</p>
<p>On the bottom left of the maps should be a control to allow you to select an RSS feed which will contain only those changes touching tiles actually
in that box. So no more sorting through (big) changesets to find which actually modify features near you!</p>
